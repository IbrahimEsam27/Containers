## Docker

Docker is a platform that enables developers to easily create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow for packaging an application with all its dependencies into a standardized unit for software development. This ensures that the application runs consistently across different environments.

## Kubernetes

Kubernetes, often abbreviated as K8s, is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Kubernetes provides a framework to run distributed systems resiliently, taking care of scaling and failover for your application, and providing deployment patterns.
